The Table Reservation System is a fully responsive, single-page website built using only HTML and CSS,
designed to let users browse restaurants, view details, and book tables effortlessly through an elegant, modern interface. 
It includes all essential features such as restaurant listings with filters, detailed information pages, a structured reservation form, booking confirmation,
and sample reservation records  all without any JavaScript. The project focuses on clean design, accessibility, and CSS-only interactivity using
selectors, making it an ideal frontend prototype for learning, 
showcasing UI skills, or serving as a foundation for future backend integration.
